# Sethub

## What is this?

Sethub is a public Github repository for everybody to share and improve their Car Setups in racing sims.

## How can I use it

The directory of the repo is nested as follows
`game->car->track->setups`. So click through the folders to find the setup you need. To use the setup you could either download the file and put it in the appropriate folder on your filesystem.

## How can I contribute

We encourage everybody to upload their setups and suggest changes to existing setups.

Issues can be used to ask questions or suggest changes to how we organize this repo.

Use merge requests to suggest changes to existing setups or to add your own setups. The naming convention for setups is a *PB* followed by the best time you drove with the setup in the dormat m_ss_SSS, *A* with the ambient temperature in celcius, *T* followed by the track temperature and an optional *D* for a very short description all seperated by a hyphen. You are free to pick what every description you like. So say we had a ACC setup for the ferrari 488 on Monza.

That'd mean the file should be named `PB1_50_45-A24-T28-DLessWingAngle.json` and be in the folder `asseto_corsa_competizione->ferrari_488_gt3_evo->monza`.

## What the f*ck is git

Git is a tool for versioning source code in teams. What makes it appealing for this use-case is it's battle tested diffing system. People can immediately see what changes you made to their setups if you keep the original form and order of the file.

If you don't know what Git is, dont worry. You should be able to navigate this repo just fine. Simply click though it like a folder on your computer and download the files you need.

To contribute you need some git knowledge tho. [This page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-git-and-how-to-use-it-c341b049ae61/) should serve as a rough overview of what git is to get you started.
